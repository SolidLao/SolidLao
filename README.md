## Hi there 👋

I am Jiale Lao, a CS Phd student at Cornell University advised by Professor [Immanuel Trummer](https://itrummer.github.io/).

I have published multiple papers in SIGMOD and VLDB conferences and received [the SIGMOD Research Highlight Award 2024](https://sigmodrecord.org/publications/sigmodRecord/2503/pdfs/02_editor_notes.pdf).

I am currently interested in leveraging advanced techniques from the Natural Language Processing field (e.g., Large Language Model) to enhance the efficiency, usability and generality of database systems:
- Efficiency
  - [GPTuner](https://github.com/SolidLao/GPTuner) for system tuning (VLDB 2024, SIGMOD Demo 2024 and Record 2025, SIGMOD Research Highlight 🏆)
  - [SQLBarber](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06192) for SQL workload generation (SIGMOD Demo 2025, Under revision of SIGMOD 2026)
  - [QUITE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07675) for query rewrite (Under revision of SIGMOD 2026)
- Generality
  - [SemBench](http://sembench.org/), a benchmark for semantic query processing engines
- Usability
  - [ToxicSQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05445) for Text-to-SQL model security (SIGMOD 2026)
